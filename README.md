# Shows-Project 

 Version of my final project that could deploy 

I used MongoDB Atlas for both of the databases, &nbsp;  Service called Vercel to host the servers, &nbsp; And Google Firebase to host the front-end.

About - This project is meant to use as a platform for the employees of a shows rent company (kind of the employees of Netflix).
The hierarchy is that the admin sets the employees and their permissions.
Then the new employees can log into the system by the username given by the admin and the initial password "1234" (in the "first time?" they need to reset the password). 
The employees (depend on their permissions) can add, edit and delete - shows and subscribers.
